# Create Stack Using Array
Stack is an abstract data structure that contains a collection of elements. Stack implements LIFO (Last-Tn-First-Out) mechanism so the element that is pushed at the end is popped out first.

Here are the stack functions that are used in the code:
- push() = adds a data value to the top of the stack.
- pop() = removes the data value on top of the stack.
- top() = returns the top data value of the stack. When empty, top value is -1.
